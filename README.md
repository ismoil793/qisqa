Have you ever used “link in bio” tools like Linktree or TapBio?  Probably yes ✔️
I decided to create one of my own, and that’s how qisqa.uz was born.

Here’s what makes it special:

✔️ A free, simple-to-use tool

✔️ Hosted on a .UZ domain 🌍

✔️ Available in 🇺🇿 Uzbek, English, Russian languages

✔️ Features beautiful background images for customization 🖼

With qisqa.uz, you can manage all your links effortlessly while enjoying a sleek and intuitive interface tailored to your needs.

👉 Check out the website here: https://qisqa.uz
👉 Explore the demo page: https://qisqa.uz/demo

Discover qisqa.uz – your all-in-one solution for managing links, with simplicity at its core.

Fun fact: “qisqa” means short in Uzbek!
